# Requirements

First, the execution of our scripts require some dependencies:
* Python
* LibreOffice
* R software, with the R packages <code>corrplot</code> and <code>ellipse</code>

The code should work properly on Unix and OSX. We do not provide the code for Windows.

# Scripts execution

To reproduce our analysis on yeast data provided by Yvert et al. (2013), please follow the next few steps:

* Download the git repository <code>SigmaFGM</code> (https://github.com/charlesrocabert/SigmaFGM/archive/master.zip)
* With your terminal, navigate to the folder <code>SigmaFGM-master/phenomics_analysis</code> using command <code>cd</code>
* Simply run the bash script with this command:

    bash run_phenomics_analysis.sh

* Wait

The resulting data is dispatched in various folders, and the pictures are located in the folder <code>pic</code>.
